      "question": "What is React?",
      "answer": "A front-end JavaScript library developed by Facebook.  It uses a component based approach and used for developing complex and interactive web and mobile applications.",

    },
    {
      "question": "What are the features of React?",
      "answer": "It uses a virtual DOM, server side rendering, and follows unidirectional data flow.",

      "showAnswer": false,
      "id": 2
    },
    {
      "question": "What are the advantages of React?",
      "answer": "It increases the application's performance, it can be used on the client and server side, JSX allows for better code readability, easily integrates with other frameworks, and it is easy to write UI test cases.",
      "topicId": "o0QCBRE",
      "showAnswer": false,
      "id": 3
    },
    {
      "question": "What are the limitations of React?",
      "answer": "It is just a library (not a full framework), the library is large and takes time to understand, and coding can become complex using inline templating and JSX.",
      "topicId": "o0QCBRE",
      "showAnswer": false,
      "id": 4
    },
    {
      "question": "What is JSX?",
      "answer": "JavaScript XML. The syntax is similar to HTML and React uses JSX to render the information to a webpage.",

      "showAnswer": false,
      "id": 5
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the virtual DOM?",
      "answer": "A JavaScript object which originally is a copy of the real DOM. It is a node tree that lists the elements, their attributes and content as Objects and their properties. Reactâ€™s render function creates a node tree out of the React components. It then updates this tree in response to the mutations in the data model.",

      "showAnswer": false,
      "id": 6
    },
    {
      "question": "How is the DOM updated?",
      "answer": "Underlying data changes, the entire UI is re-rendered in the Virtual DOM.  Then the difference between the previous DOM representation and the new one is calculated. Once the calculations are complete, the real DOM will be updated with only the things that have changed.  ",

    },
    {
      "question": "What's the difference between a class and functional component?",
      "answer": "A class-based component extends React's Component class and implements a render() method.  A functional component is stateless and returns the output to be rendered.  ",

      "id": 8
    },
    {
      "question": "What are keys used for?",
      "answer": "When rendering collections in React, a key is added to each repeated element to help React track the association between elements and data. The key should be a unique ID.",

    {
      "question": "What are two paradigms that are important for JS developers?",
      "answer": "Prototypal inheritance (OOP) and functional programming",

      "showAnswer": false,
      "id": 10
    },
    {
      "question": "What is functional programming?",
      "answer": "Uses mathematical functions and avoids shared state and mutable data.  Pure functions, avoid side-effects, simple function composition, higher order functions, first-class functions, functions as args/values",
      "topicId": "1Swch-b",
      "showAnswer": false,
      "id": 11
    },
    {
      "question": "What is classical inheritance?",
      "answer": "Instances inherit from classes and create sub-class relationships.  Typically instantiated via constructor functions with 'new' keyword. Creates tight coupling or hierarchies/taxonomies.",
      "topicId": "1Swch-b",
      "showAnswer": false,
      "id": 12
    },
    {
      "question": "What is prototypal inheritance?",
      "answer": "Instances inherit directly from other objects.  Instantiated via factory functions or 'Object.create()'.  Instances can be composed of many different objects allowing for easy selective inheritance.",
      "topicId": "1Swch-b",
      "showAnswer": false,
      "id": 13
    },
    {
      "question": "What are pros and cons of object oriented programming?",
      "answer": "Pros: Easy to understand. Tends to use imperative style instead of declarative which is easier to read.\n\nCons: Typically depends on shared state",
      "topicId": "1Swch-b",
      "showAnswer": false,
      "id": 14
    },
    {
      "question": "What are the pros and cons of functional programming?",
      "answer": "Pros: No need for shared state, easier to create reusable code when compared to OOP.\n\nCons: Less readability, steeper learning curve",

      "id": 15
    },
    {
      "question": "When is classical inheritance an appropriate choice?",
      "answer": "Almost never.  Never more than one level.  Favor object composition over class inheritance.",

      "showAnswer": false,
      "id": 16
    },
    {
      "question": "What is asynchronous programming?",
      "answer": "The engine runs in an event loop. When a blocking operation is needed the request is started, and the code keeps running without blocking for the result.  When the response is ready, an interrupt is fired, which causes an event handler to run, where control flow continues.  It is important in JS because it is user interface code and is beneficial to server performance. ",

    },
    {
      "question": "What is a closure?",
      "answer": "The combination of a function enclosed with references to its surrounding state. It gives you access to an outer function's scope from an inner function.",
