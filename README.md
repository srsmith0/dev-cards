# Welcome to Dev Cards!

I created this to help prepare for applying to jobs. It is a simple flashcard application
that uses a local JSON server to keep track of all created cards. Redux is used to keep
track of cards you need to focus on in a study session. I have included a stack of React
cards and will add more when I have time. If you would like add topics and cards, please
do and share!

# Get Dev Cards

2. Change into the cloned repo directory and run `npm install`.
3. To start the server, run `npm run json:server`.
4. To start the application, run `npm run start`.
5. You can now access all parts of the application. Add topics or cards with the green '+'.
